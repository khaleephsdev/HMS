Hostel Management System

New user Registration form and login system is working well but booking a room is not working because 
no data is updating in the database when you successfully submit the form.

I try to test with different tables and even reduce the form columns to avoid confexity but still the same issue and there is no error
showing up so i dont even know where the problem is all about.
